# ImagePullBackOff Scenario - Simulates Invalid Image
#
# This deployment will fail to start because:
# 1. Image tag doesn't exist in the registry
# 2. Kubernetes repeatedly tries to pull the image
# 3. Pull fails each time
# 4. Pod remains in ImagePullBackOff state
#
# Expected Alert: KubePodNotReady or KubePodImagePullBackOff
# Expected Investigation: Agent should identify image pull failure

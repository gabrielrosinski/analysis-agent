# Context Restoration Prompt for Next Session

I need to continue development of the analysis-agent project. Here's the context:


## Project Context

You are continuing development of the **Kagent DevOps RCA System** - an AI-powered Root Cause Analysis agent for Kubernetes that automatically investigates AlertManager alerts and provides actionable solutions via email.

**Current Status**: MVP Phase - Documentation simplification completed (Phase 2)

## What We Just Completed (Session 2025-10-12)

### Goal Achieved
Simplified installation by removing Docker build requirement for end users. Users now run single `helm install` command with zero configuration.

### Changes Made
1. **Created 3 new docs**:
   - `docs/DOCKER_BUILD.md` - For maintainers only
   - `docs/ROADMAP.md` - Future features (v0.2.0 to v0.6.0)
   - `docs/IMAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Separation of concerns

2. **Modified 7 files**:
   - `README.md` - Removed duplicate installation steps
   - `docs/INSTALLATION.md` - Removed Step 2 (Docker build), renumbered all steps
   - `docs/HELM_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Removed duplication, added prerequisites link
   - `chart/analysis-agent/values.yaml` - Updated default images to `ghcr.io/your-org/analysis-agent-*:0.1.0`
   - `chart/analysis-agent/README.md` - 3 clear installation options
   - Both deployment templates - Verified correct image references

### Key Architecture Decision
**Separation of Concerns**:
- **Maintainers**: Build and publish images to ghcr.io (one-time)
- **values.yaml**: Single source of truth for default image references
- **End Users**: Just run `helm install` (zero Docker config)
- **Advanced Users**: Override with `--set` or custom values file

### Benefits
- Installation time: Reduced from ~45-50 min to ~30 min (15-20 min saved)
- Installation steps: Reduced from 7 to 6 steps
- User experience: Zero Docker knowledge required

## Current Project State

### What's Working
✅ Complete project structure (services, tools, manifests, chart)
✅ Documentation consolidated (single source of truth: INSTALLATION.md)
✅ Helm chart with pre-built image defaults
✅ Clear separation: maintainer vs user tasks

### What Needs To Be Done

**IMMEDIATE (Before testing)**:
1. **Build and publish Docker images to GHCR** (maintainer task)
   ```bash
   docker build -t ghcr.io/your-org/analysis-agent-webhook:0.1.0 services/webhook
   docker build -t ghcr.io/your-org/analysis-agent-notifier:0.1.0 services/notifier
   docker push ghcr.io/your-org/analysis-agent-webhook:0.1.0
   docker push ghcr.io/your-org/analysis-agent-notifier:0.1.0
   ```

2. **Test end-to-end installation** following docs/INSTALLATION.md

3. **Update CLAUDE.md** (if needed) with references to new docs

**NEXT FEATURES** (Choose one to implement):
- **Option A**: Slack integration (v0.2.0)
- **Option B**: RAG system to replace markdown memory (v0.3.0)
- **Option C**: GitHub Actions MCP integration (v0.4.0)

## Key Files to Reference

**Documentation**:
- `README.md` - Project overview
- `docs/INSTALLATION.md` - Complete installation guide ⭐
- `docs/DOCKER_BUILD.md` - Maintainer: building images
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` - Future features roadmap
- `docs/IMAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architecture decisions
- `CLAUDE.md` - Development guidance for Claude

**Development Planning**:
- `development/development_plan.md` - Overall 6-phase project plan
- `development/development_phase2.md` - Detailed Phase 2 summary (reference only)

**Core Implementation**:
- `agents/devops-rca-agent.yaml` - Kagent agent definition
- `services/webhook/` - AlertManager webhook receiver (FastAPI)
- `services/notifier/` - Email notification service (FastAPI)
- `tools/` - Custom Python tools (memory, helm, logs, github)
- `chart/analysis-agent/` - Helm chart for deployment

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd "/mnt/c/Devops projects/analysis-agent"

# Review recent changes
git status
git diff

# Verify Helm chart
helm lint ./chart/analysis-agent
helm template ./chart/analysis-agent --debug

# Check current images in values.yaml
grep -A 5 "image:" chart/analysis-agent/values.yaml
```

## Questions to Ask User

1. **Image Publishing**: Should we publish images to ghcr.io now, or use different registry (Docker Hub, ECR)?
2. **Next Feature**: Which feature should we implement next? (Slack, RAG, or MCP)
3. **Testing**: Should we create automated tests for Helm chart before continuing?
4. **Documentation**: Any confusion in installation docs that needs clarification?

## Important Notes

- **Git Commit Pending**: Changes from Phase 2 need to be committed
- **Images Not Published**: Default values.yaml references `ghcr.io/your-org/*` but images don't exist yet
- **No Testing Done**: End-to-end installation not tested yet
- **Kagent Operator**: User already has Kagent installed in their cluster

## Your Task

Help the user with their next request. If they ask "where did we leave off?" or "what's next?", refer to this context. Be ready to:
1. Publish Docker images if requested
2. Test installation end-to-end
3. Implement next feature from roadmap
4. Fix any issues discovered during testing



What should we work on next?

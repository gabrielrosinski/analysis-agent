## Version 0.3.0 - Advanced Intelligence

Target: Q3 2025

### 1. RAG System (Replace Memory Module)

**Vector Database Integration**
- Replace markdown-based memory with vector DB (Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma)
- Semantic search across historical incidents
- Similarity-based pattern matching
- Automatic knowledge base updates

**Benefits:**
- Find similar incidents even with different wording
- Scale to thousands of incidents
- Real-time similarity scoring
- Automated clustering of related issues

**Architecture:**
```
Alert → Agent → Vector DB Search → Similar Incidents → Enhanced Context → LLM Analysis
```

### 2. Predictive Analysis

**Proactive Alerting**
- Pattern detection before failures occur
- Trend analysis on metrics
- Resource exhaustion prediction
- Anomaly detection

**Example Use Cases:**
- "Disk space will be full in 3 days based on current growth"
- "Memory leak detected, pod will OOM in 2 hours"
- "Certificate expires in 7 days"

### 3. Root Cause Confidence Scoring

**Confidence Levels**
- High (90%+): Clear evidence, single root cause
- Medium (60-89%): Multiple possible causes
- Low (<60%): Insufficient evidence, needs human review

**Evidence Weighting**
- Log errors: High weight
- Metric anomalies: Medium weight
- Recent changes: High weight
- Temporal correlation: Medium weight

### 2. Multi-Agent Collaboration

**Agent Types:**
- **RCA Agent** (current): Root cause analysis
- **Security Agent**: Vulnerability scanning, compliance checks
- **Performance Agent**: Query optimization, resource tuning
- **Cost Agent**: Cost analysis, optimization recommendations

**Agent Communication:**
- Shared knowledge base
- Cross-agent consultation
- Coordinated investigations
- Consolidated reports

**Example Workflow:**
```
Alert → RCA Agent → (consults Security Agent) → Combined Report
```

## Version 0.5.0 - Auto-Remediation

Target: Q1 2026

### 1. Automated Fixes with Approval

**Safe Auto-Remediation:**
- Pre-approved fix patterns (rollback, restart, scale)
- Dry-run mode
- Human approval workflow
- Rollback if fix fails

**Approval Levels:**
- **Auto**: Known safe fixes (restart pod, clear cache)
- **One-Click**: Human approves via Slack/Teams button
- **Manual**: Human performs fix with agent guidance

**Example Auto-Fix:**
```yaml
auto_remediation:
  enabled: true
  approval_required: true
  allowed_actions:
    - type: rollback_deployment
      auto_approve: true
    - type: scale_replicas
      auto_approve: false  # Needs approval
    - type: restart_pods
      auto_approve: true
```

### 2. Remediation Playbooks

**Custom Playbooks:**
- YAML-based fix definitions
- Conditional logic
- Multi-step procedures
- Validation checks

**Example Playbook:**
```yaml
playbook: fix_oom_killed
triggers:
  - alert: KubePodOOMKilled
steps:
  1. Increase memory limit by 50%
  2. Restart pod
  3. Monitor for 10 minutes
  4. If stable, update deployment
  5. If fails, rollback
```
